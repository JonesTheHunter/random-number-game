Random Number Game by Donnie Hostillo

Just a little beginner project game I made.
Thanks to techwithtim (Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) for the tutorial that got me started.
Ended up adding some gamemodes and commands. Potentially more to come!

Current Commands:
quit - quits the game
h - gives hints (Off by Default)
enablehint - enables hints
disablehint - disables hints
hist - shows previously guess numbers for oldest to newest
enablehist - enable history
disablehist - disable history

Current Gamemodes
1. Easy (10 numbers)
2. Medium (100 numbers)
3. Hard (1,000 numbers)
4. Expert (1,000,000 numbers)
5. Master (1,000,000,000 numbers)
6. Nightmare (1,000,000,000,000 numbers)
7. Custom

Current Modifiers
Disable Hints Commands - Prevents use of Hints Command
Disable History Commands - Prevents use of History Command
