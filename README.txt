Random Number Game by Donnie Hostillo

Just a little beginner project game I made.
Thanks to techwithtim (Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) for the tutorial that got me started.
Ended up adding some gamemodes and commands. Potentially more to come!

Current Commands:
quit - quits the game
h - gives hints (Off by Default)
enablehint - enables hints
disablehint - disables hints
hist - shows previously guess numbers for oldest to newest
enablehist - enable history
disablehist - disable history
